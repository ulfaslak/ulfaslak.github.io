The human eye is an ultra-optimized pattern recognition machine. A data visualization is a piece of computer art that brings out patterns hidden in a dataset, for the eye to make sense of.

## I'm new here, please elaborate

Visualizations can be static pages, printable for the office wall, or fully interactive and running in your browser. Typically, a visualization is *explorable* meaning that it allows multiple layers of understanding, from the sensible at glance to the deeply insightful upon near inspection. Your classical spreadsheet bar charts and scatter plots are also data visualizations, but of the boring kind that disengages people because it reminds them of their 7th grade math teacher who took away their confidence with numbers. Great visualizations do the opposite—they make you forget about the numbers and let you focus on the phenomenon.

Leveraging modern web technologies and advances in recent scientific computing power, we can make genuinely interesting and beautiful visualizations of datasets that communicate and inspire.

## Who needs their data visualized?

Given the droves of data and high performing computers that today's knowledge workers interact with and rely on, visualization has become a widely used tool. Visualization is used by:
* Scientists to understand their models and explore their data [[1](https://observablehq.com/@ulfaslak/a-model-for-generating-multiscale-mobility-traces), [2](https://observablehq.com/@ulfaslak/a-visual-exploration-of-how-a-power-law-can-emerge-from-aggre)]
* Teachers to communicate the mathematically complex [[3](https://www.complexity-explorables.org/)]
* BI specialists to investigate patterns and explain their results
* Journalists to explain statistics and phenomena to their readers [[4](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/upshot/election-2016-voting-precinct-maps.html#3.61/41.36/-97.29), [5](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/world/corona-simulator/)]
* Software developers to understand algorithm behavior [[6](https://observablehq.com/@tmcw/enigma-machine)]
* UX designers to prototype interface components [[7](https://observablehq.com/@benmaier/a-visually-more-appealing-fisheye-function)]
* Mathematicians to make generative art [[8](https://observablehq.com/@mootari/getting-artsy-with-lloyd)]


## Should I get me one of these visualiza-things?

At Super Duper Evil Co. we specialize in delivering crisp and delicious data visualizations for those in need. Have a look at [stuff we did in the past](). Whether you need it or not depends entirely on what datasets you are sitting on and what insight you imagine drawing from it. Which can be hard to know if you are not an expert in data science. But worry not we are here to help! Get in touch right away and let's jam.
