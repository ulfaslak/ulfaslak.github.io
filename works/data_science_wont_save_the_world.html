        <b>If you want to feel good, do good things</b> says an old stoic advice. I find examples everywhere that supports this wisdom. It explains a deep and painful frustration that always followed big successes in my life. Extremely hard work and sacrifice exchanged for high grades and certificates. I was constantly working towards these but never derived any satisfaction from their actual achievement. Which made me work even harder because, I assumed, I simply had not set the bar high enough.

        I understand now, of course, that the whole purpose of "achievements" is not the award but the work you deliver. Goals exist so someone can work towards them, and it is an effective mechanism for making someone work. I tell my toddler that he is a big boy if he gets into the carseat by himself, and that spares my back and boosts his self-confidence. Everyone wins.

        Educational systems work like this. You are set up for an ultimate award, a certificate that justifies your hardship and sacrifice, and sets you on a new path to a bright future. You obtain a certificate that states your skill level and enables you to market yourself so you can make some money, and society gets another pair of hands in their workforce. You also learned some things, but, well, more on that later.

        There are great arguments for this model. Kids need a foundation of knowledge, that can only be obtained through hard work. We need to star them young. University offers a system of goals that gives people something to work towards and in turn obtain specialist knowlege in different market-relevant areas. And society <it>needs</it> certifications. You want your lawyer, doctor and airline pilot to have one. Some jobs just require a very specific body of knowledge and training, that only a narrow path of learning can provide. School is great for this.

        So why the frustration? After all, here I am, writing this paragraph in the comfort of my home that I pay for with the money from my job that I have as a direct consequence of my fine diplomas.

        Because I am not a fucking doctor or an airline pilot! Technologies emerge, markets shift and regulations change. My job did not exist 10 years ago and neither did most of the other high-demand jobs of today, so there is absolutely no way anyone will know what skills are in demand 10 years from now. Among knowledge workers, divergent thinkers and complex problem solvers there is one skill that matters: <b>being able to figure shit out yourself</b>. Unfortunately, this is the one skill they don't teach in school. It does not align with the work/award model, so instead they mint an endless stream of professionals that come into the world expecting instructions. Ever wondered why most jobs require previous work experience? Well, now you know.

        Back when I was in school I understood this on an emotional level. A poorly contextualized and difficult topic taught by an unmotivated teacher—who probably had greater worries than whether a curriculum item was relevant in the current and future job market—made me anxious. As a child I would ask "what is this used for" and I would usually get the same answer "it's on the test". So I learned to learn what was on the test. It was not until I had my first encounter with the real world that I discovered that everything was wrong with my learning.

        I started as an undergraduate researcher at a small company where I was simultaneously working on my bachelor's thesis. Coming into it I thought I was well equipped to start working, but I quickly discovered that I had exactly zero of the skills required to do anything by myself. I could solve a partial differential equation for fluid flow in a membrane filtraion module, but I couldn't code and make a numerical simulation. This freaked me out quite a bit were it not for ther older PhD student who mentored me I would have had a full blown breakdown.

        My mentor helped me set my own goals for my project, taught me some basic concepts and guided me on research journey. I ran the simulations, made the figures and typed in the words, but the thesis I wrote was at least 50% his work. It luckily turned out well, and we even published an article in a scientific journal. But something much more profound had occured within me: I had lost all trust that classes could provide a sufficient knowledge and skill foundation for real-world work. My attitude towards the university had forever changed.

        In the following semesters I maxed out on special credits, and did many projects with researchers and other students. I aimed at taking courses where instead of an exam there would be a student-defined product deliverable. I started coding which was empowering to say the least. The old-style classes I had still bored me but I found it easier to derive specific knowledge from them because now I often would have a problem from one my projects that I could apply it to. For my own sake, I built a portfolio of my data science projects, making public display the goal of my hard work. During this time, I spent much longer days at the university, and felt far less of the stress and anxiety of before.

        At the time I did not realize it, but what I was doing right was hacking my motivational system by redefining the goals into something that was my own, allowing me to work out of inner motivation. I did not understand that this was the only reason why I was so happy, even though I was working all the time sparing little time for friends and family. I just enjoyed finally feeling great about going to the university every day. I enjoyed the attention I got from other students who suddenly thought I was very smart and worth asking all sorts of questions, that I gladly answered because usually I would know. I enjoyed being respected by my professors and having high-level technical discussions with the teaching assistants.

        It went on like this for a long time. I started on my PhD in a successful research group with interesting problems and great culture. I had known my supervisor from a course I took and he trusted me to do my own thing. When I struggled with ideas he would lend me his creative mind and together we did some really cool things. I was always very eager to build and make things, and he let my data visualizations, Python packages etc. have a place in the research.

        And then it was over. I graduated. I ran out of studying. The Danish educational system could not offer me any more diplomas to work towards. Had I been offered it, I would have gladly accepted another degree, but instead I continued in various assistant professor and postdoc roles until I eventually lost all motivation and started seeing red everytime something had to get published or a review invitation came my way. I had a lot of built up aggression towards academia and slowly became like one of those people on Twitter that complain about Twitter. So I quit out of self-compassion.

        I took a data science job in a bank. They did not have the most interesting problems, but it was a fine challenge and the salary was good. I was running on discipline and good manners for a while and it afforded me some hard-to-earn software development skills that I wouldn't be without. But eventually I also lost my motivation because I couldn't really say why I was doing what I was doing.

        Eventually I found my way into a small startup with a very meaningful agenda. We are building important software and every day we are making headway down a path that we define. I decide important things about this process. Yesterday I spend 8 hours reading the PDF syntax manual by Adobe because I needed to understand something about how data is stored in that format. And I wasn't bored.

        So here's my suggestion to a revised method of teaching in 2021. We can have courses and learning curricula alright. But whenever you ask a student to learn something they did not choose, you tell them why. And if they keep asking why they end answer has to be "so you can solve a problem that is yours".
        You ask the kid if they have a problem they would like to solve. If they can't come up with a good problem, talk to them and lead them down the road of curiosity. The important thing is just that you do not know the answer and they know that you don't know. The problem has to be interesting and fun. Figuring out what is fun and interesting for a kid demands you pay attention to them, so pay attention. And then you stick around and mentor them through their process.



        Although I remain highly critical of education, I must acknowledge that it was the venue for some of my most influential encounters. I want to thank especially three people without whom things would have looked way different for me.
        * Annette Otto for teaching me to write
        * Bo Brøndsted for making mathematics interesting
        * Sune Lehmann for letting me figure shit out myself
