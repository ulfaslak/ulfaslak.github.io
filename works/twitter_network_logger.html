      <h1>Twitter network logger</h1>
      <p><em>2019</em></p>

    <div class="text wrap">
      <p>
        Something I like to do when there's extra activity around a specific
        topic, is to
        <strong>record the network of people interacting</strong> around that
        topic on Twitter. Specifically, I collect all tweets that contain a set
        of keywords that identify the topic, then I maintain a list of users
        that have posted or retweeted those tweets and check out which other
        users on that list they liked tweets from. This yields a three-layer
        network temporal network. One layer describe the network of likes,
        another the network of retweets and finally the network of mentions
        (this also includes comments).
      </p>

      <p>
        My first attempt at doing that was during the 2018 NetSci conference
        where I got a little bored and figured I needed to know who was top dawg
        in the network science community (spoiler: it's not me). I hacked up a
        continuous Twitter data collection script that pushed the data to a
        Github Gist, and set it to run every 15 minutes on a remote server. Then
        I built a online data visualization in JavaScript that on every page
        load would read the latest version of the dataset.

        >.

      <p>
        <strong>Then pretty recently</strong> in Copenhagen, this insane Danish
        fascist YouTuber burned a Quran in a Muslim-dense neighborhood and
        announced his candidacy for the Danish parlament, and in perfect Trump
        style all the cameras stopped pointing at serious people and started
        focussing all their attention of that guy (well done social media!). So
        since I'm no better, I figured I would revisit my old Twitter network
        logger and point it at this guy. So here's the network of likes.

        <figure>

        </figure>

        Basically, there's two clusters in this network, one small one that is
        very tight knit of co-fascist sympathizers liking each others tweets,
        and another larger more diffused one of (I suppose) people talking about
        what a crazy horrible person he is. And making this plot was super easy,
        I just copied the
        <a
          href="https://gist.githubusercontent.com/ulfaslak/be4a6123fdde340870814db61c648ec6/raw/d0f2dd8826d5ae906db98296b5683060a725c9a1/likes.csv"
          >raw URL</a
        >
        from
        <a
          href="https://gist.github.com/ulfaslak/be4a6123fdde340870814db61c648ec6"
          >the Github Gist</a
        >
        that the logger pushed to and inserted it into my
        <a href="https://ulfaslak.dk/works/network_styling_with_d3/index.html"
          >online version of Netwulf</a
        >. Then I styled it a bit until I thought it looked cool.
      </p>

      <p>
        Also, since I wanted to be able to reboot this little wiretapping scheme
        anytime, I did a bit of work making it easy to launch. Now, you clone a
        Github repository, create a gist to host the data and then run a Python
        script with some arguments that depend on what you want to log. It's all
        described on
        <a href="https://github.com/ulfaslak/twitter_network_logger"
          >the Github repository</a
        >.
