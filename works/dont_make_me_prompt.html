        Imagine if Tony Stark had to carefully prompt Jarvis and explicitly manage his context.
      </p>

      <p>
        When I started using GitHub Copilot in 2022, it seemed obvious that the future of coding would be
        Ironman/Jarvis-style "deep autocomplete" keeping the developer in flow, unblocking them at every
        friction point, making them FASTER, meanwhile keeping them in control.
      </p>

      <p>
        That's not at all where we're at now. We currently have conversational agents.
        <strong>Prompt</strong> (carefully) → <strong>wait</strong> → <strong>review</strong> (boring, let's skip) → <strong>repeat</strong>.
        They're truly powerful. Smart people build elaborate systems of context management around this
        interface and produce impressive software.
      </p>

      <p>
        But <strong>the problem is</strong> that prompting in natural language is a low-bandwidth interface
        for expressing developer intent. A child can hum a tune to express a musical idea, but a composer
        can write in precise notation. So why exactly do we force expert software composers to hum like
        little children?
      </p>

      <p>
        For code composers, prompting is poor ergonomics. It gives me something I call
        <strong>prompting fatigue</strong>. I never wanted to prompt. I wanted to code, get super-smart,
        deep AI autocomplete, and occasionally prompt the agent with questions to get tailored answers.
      </p>

      <p>
        I keep thinking about Tony Stark. He doesn't ask Jarvis to fly. He moves and the suit amplifies.
        The intelligence is in service of his intent, not a separate stateless actor with its own agency.
      </p>

      <p>
        What if the IDE watched my edits and inferred what I'm trying to do?
        <strong>What if my behavior was the prompt?</strong> A system that translates developer behavior
        into the prompts that would have produced the right completions. Without the developer having to
        write those prompts.
      </p>

      <p>
        Concretely: Ghost diffs that appear when I rename a function, showing me the ripple effect across
        files. Tab to accept, Esc to dismiss. No chat. The agent learns what I want from what I accept.
        Over time, it just knows.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is what I wanted Copilot to become. Maybe it's time to build it.
