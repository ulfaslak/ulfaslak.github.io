    <div class="text wrap">
      <p>
        A year into my PhD my supervisor Sune Lehmann presented me with a
        puzzling contradiction within the study of how humans move from place to
        place. Geographers mostly agreed with the common sense notion that the
        distances humans travel between places belong to different scales. We
        can move between rooms thus traveling at the scale of the building,
        between buildings at the scale of the city, between cities at region
        scale and so on. The contradiction, he pointed out, arose because recent
        work in physics analysing human travel distances from cell phone data
        found no evidence of scales. The physicsists showed that travel
        distances were distribution as a power-law, characteristic for its lack
        of scale.
      </p>

      <p>
        Well-established geography and modern physics were in disagreement, and
        we grew obsessed with resolving this paradox. We wanted to show that
        with large enough amounts of sufficiently resolved GPS data we could
        indeed find scales in human mobility. We wanted to describe their
        average sizes, understand how freqently they were traveled at by
        different types of people and much more. Our leading assumption was that
        the scale-free result was simply an artifact of aggregation. Laura
        Alessandretti joined our research group as a postdoc and shared our
        obsession immediately. Thus began an intense and exciting adventure.
      </p>

      <p>
        Here is a crude account. First, we wrote a comprehensive and very useful
        <a href="https://github.com/ulfaslak/infostop">software package</a> for
        finding stop-locations in sequencial GPS data. This enabled us to take
        raw GPS sequences and turn them into sequences of place names. We then
        discovered that plotting the distribution of distances traveled for an
        individual did clearly not yield a power-law distribution, but rather
        showed with great clarity the different scales that they traveled at.
        Now, we just needed a model for assign scale to journeys. Thus followed
        a series of wild but fruitless ideas. Initially, we believed the key to
        labeling trips was to understand their context, so we developed a
        grammer of nested trips in location sequences and a measure of location
        "starness". We could now identify whether a place in a sequence of
        visited places was a keystone place where trips start and end—a location
        where one, for example, drops ones stuff, takes off from, and returns
        to—or simply an intermediate location within a trip—like a shop visit on
        the way or a gas station. Writing this, I wonder what the hell we were
        thinking, but at the time I am sure we saw some connection to the
        greater problem of inferring scale of mobility events.
      </p>

      <p>
        The breakthroughs came when we started thinking about human travel
        simply as movements between containers in a nested hiearchy. This idea
        had come up early in the initial fog of ideas, but seemed out of reach
        for quick testing. Eventually, however, we developed
        <a
          href="https://observablehq.com/@ulfaslak/a-model-for-generating-multiscale-mobility-traces"
          >a dead simple simulating of travel on a nested grid</a
        >. This simulation brought us immense insight. The traces it generated
        <em>looked real</em>, and reproduced the scale-ful distributions of
        travel distances we observed in our initial plots. Having implemented it
        in a fast interactive framework, we could tweak parameters and
        understand their influence on dynamics. Based on this, we could write an
        equation for the probability of moving from one place to another given a
        hierarchy of containers. This, we used as the objective function in a
        maximum likelihood fitting procedure to find the nested grid that best
        fit the simulated travel.
      </p>

      <p>
        We were stuck in the grid-mindset for a little while and stuggled with
        translating it to real human travel data. First, we tried to fit a
        spherical nested grid onto the globe... again, I don't know what the
        hell we were thinking, and though it worked in the computer the results
        were rediculous and obviously constrained by the grid. Having slept on
        it for a sufficient number of night we realized that we did not need a
        grid, and could use our equation to estimate the probability of a
        movement given <em>any</em> hierarchy of containers. We then devised a
        method for iterating over all possible
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complete-linkage_clustering"
          >linkage clustering</a
        >
        solutions, estimating likelihood and picking the best one.
      </p>

      <p>
        In pragmatic terms, what we ended up making was a clustering method.
        Where most clustering methods take as input just a collection of points,
        our method takes as input a collection of points and a sequence of moves
        between them. Its output is a nested partition of places into
        containers, as well as a scale labeling of each individual movement. It
        optimizes the partition using maximum likelihood estimation. When
        visualized on a map, containers typically resemble known neighborhoods,
        cities, urban agglomeration, regions, countries, and continents.
      </p>

      <p>
        How does this resolve Sune's contradiction? Through a number of tests we
        show that the containers and scales our method consistently finds for
        tens of millions of individuals across the world are non-artifactual,
        but strictly a property of the data. For example, if we simulate
        scale-free traces with
        <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms9166">the EPR model</a>
        the method finds no scales. We also show that the scale-free result of
        earlier research can easily emerge
