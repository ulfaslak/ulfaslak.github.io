EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis. We would explain, but there is a really good [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_data_analysis) that will bring us to the same page.

## When we explore data
For us, EDA is the process of scanning data for value. What are the statistics of the variables? Do any of them correlate unexpectedly? Are there systematic biases and missing data that can be corrected? What does that outlier mean? We like to get real curious and immerse ourselves into the dataset, both as a way of getting familiar with the data and drawing some early insight out of it, which can keep you hooked on our service.

## EDA for its own sake or as a means to an end?
Depends.

If your business is early in the phase of exploring your data, our EDA work should be a goal in itself. Here, we will deliver something to the effect of a report that tells you what we think you can and cannot do with your data. Maybe we will discover that user churn can be predicted with a 70% accuracy, or that your product is really popular among teens in Israel during Passover. We get specific.

If the end goal of our work is to produce a neat interactive data visualization, EDA is the process through which we learn what insights should derive from exploring the visualization. Maybe the lines should display weekend values on shift-hold because aggregating across all weekdays is statistically irresponsible. Maybe there should be a button to log-scale the axes because those outliers are too interesting to remove.
