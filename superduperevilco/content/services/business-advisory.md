Ignorance is not bliss. It is an expensive waste of opportunity. It is downright irresponsible. We have a keen eye for low hanging fruit, so let us have a look at your data and your business and maybe we can spot some.

## Data FOMO
If there is anything worse than not making use of potentially empowering data, it is not knowing that you are missing out. One day a handful of 20-somethings with a startup will have boarded all your clients and you will not know what happened. You have to sell the house and your wife leaves. But the greatest pain is knowing that it was your own fault for passing on that data-schmata fad.


If this troubles your dream filled sleep recall the saying: "If you don't know, call Super Duper Evil Co." We are here to help. Let us have a look at your stuff and we can quickly tell you if you should worry or not. Imagine the hours of peaceful rest you will gain when you hear us say the words: "nope nothing to see here, keep going". Or the exciting future that lies ahead when we spot amazing opportunities in your data.

## Bullshit guarantee
There is a lot of snakeoil out there. And maybe that is what you want because you have bosses in management to impress, but then we kindly redirect you to the data science consultants at BCG, EY and IBM, they wear nice suits and charge a fee that will convince any chief officer that the job got done.

We sell diamonds. We sell disappointment. Whatever we mine in your data we give to you for the agreed upon price. No holding your insights hostage because we have a department of sales people to feed (gourmet lunch).
