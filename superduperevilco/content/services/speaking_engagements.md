Explaining is what we do all day. Mostly using code that runs in your browser, but sometimes also in person with language, gestures and slides. 

## We're pretty good at it
We are diverse hybrids with one leg in academia, one in research and one in industry (yes, three legs). This gives us a unique viewpoint when we talk about various topics relating to data and the science around it.

With years of experience teaching Machine Learning and Data Science to university students at all levels, we have adequate theoretical insight to guarantee competent and intuitive treatment of a wide array of interesting topics and facilitate stimulating discussions around these.

But as empirical researchers and consultants, we are professionals in turning the theoretical practical. Some methods are analytically beautiful but practically unnecessary, while others are hardly mathematical yet incredible powerful. We pick the latter.

## Stuff we like to talk about
Humans learn optimally in emotionally safe and stressless environments, so we keep things simple. No math equations, unless for very good reasons. Questions and interruptions allowed. We can talk for minutes or for hours, this really depends on topic and context. In random order, here is an unexhaustive list of things we can elaborate on so no one leaves in confusion:
* Data
	* Why data is so insanely valuable
	* How clear conscience companies extract value from data
	* How ruthlessly evil companies extract value from data
	* Where the law fails the public, and what to expect from lawmakers
* Data visualization
	* How it is a lens for inspection
	* When you need it and when you don't
	* How it can add value
* Data Science
	* Machine learning sounds cool but it is not for everyone
	* What is deep learning and AI? Who needs it?
	* Why things are never linear (and the consequences of pretending)
* Ethics
	* Bias in machine learning (racist algos)
	* Scientism and how to sell a lie with charts
	* Social media and why advertisers are boycotting Facebook
